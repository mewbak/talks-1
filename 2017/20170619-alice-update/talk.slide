* fer

`fer` is a Go-based toolkit compatible with the `C++` `O2` framework, developed for Run-3.

* fer - update

`fer` was presented at last ALICE Offline week: [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/624025/][here]].

- no tomatoes were thrown,
- ALICE software coordinator enthusiastic,
- FAIR software coordinator, ditto.

Success.

* fer - update II

For the ALICE Offline week presentation, developed a program to show the interesting features of [[https://golang.org][Go]]:

- static compilation, "duck-typing" *interfaces*, easy cross-compilation
- easy concurrency (*goroutines*, *channels*), garbage collector
- fast development, fast runtime, easy deployment
- network programming

Created a little web browser based driver for the standard `sampler/processor/sink` example:

 $> go get github.com/sbinet-alice/fer/example/cmd/fer-ex-web-ctl
 $> fer-ex-web-ctl &
 $> open localhost:8080

* fer: (web) demo time

You can try it now, w/o any [[https://golang.org][Go]] toolchain.

Download it (for your OS/arch) from [[https://cern.ch/binet/alice/fer]]

 $> curl -O -L https://cern.ch/binet/alice/fer/fer-ex-web-ctl-linux-amd64.exe
 $> ./fer-ex-web-ctl-linux-amd64.exe

Buzz words compliant:

- WebSockets
- JSON & binary serialization via (runtime type) reflection
- concurrency (via goroutines+channels)
- cloud friendly

* fer - update III

Developed more I/O capabilities _wrt_ `ROOT` during last MRRTF hackathon.
Now can read `ROOT` `TFiles` and `TTrees` that contain data like (see [[https://go-hep.org/x/hep/rootio][go-hep.org]]):
