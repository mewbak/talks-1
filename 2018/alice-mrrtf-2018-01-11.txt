MRRTF Status Meeting - 2018-01-09
=================================

- fer didn't see much activity in its repo
- go-hep/rootio updates
- development of a C/C++-free library for ZeroMQ
  - not everything is there yet
  - no performance numbers yet
  - but easy installation step (singular! `go get zeromq`)
  - this was done in the context of neugram, a Go interpreter

- nice secondary benefits:
  - Go can be run in Jupyter
  - go-fer can be run in Jupyter (not tested!)
  - go-hep/rootio can be run in Jupyter

- demo:
