## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

  - international annual program financed by Google since 2005
  - program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development

  - in 2005: 40 projects and 400 students
  - in 2018: >200 organisations and >12500 students from ~150 countries

## CERN-HSF umbrella

  - CERN participated since 2011 and expanded to a wider HEP software ecosystem as Umbrella Organisation last year.

in 2018:

  - 64 organisations/projects with 80 mentors
  - 107 proposals and 29 students selected and allocated by Google
  - 3 IN2P3 laboratories (LAL, LPC, LLR) with 4 proposals (CPU Race, Spark3D, HAhRD, Pure-Go XRootD)

## How it works

Students:

  - Choose an Open Source community
  - Propose a project
  - Spend summer coding

## GSoC

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com):

  - Google pays students to work on open source projects
  - 3 months (during the summer)

Since 2017, [CERN-HSF](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) is a participating organization.

[@sbinet](https://github.com/sbinet) (through LPC & CERN-HSF) mentored a couple of students.

2017:

  - [Jet clustering optimizations in Go](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/blob/master/_gsocproposals/2017/proposal_GoHEPFADS.md)
  - [Launching Wagon, a WebAssembly interpreter in Go](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/blob/master/_gsocproposals/2017/proposal_GoInterpreterWagon.md)
  - [Updating gopy to support Python3 and PyPy](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/blob/master/_gsocproposals/2017/proposal_GoPythonGoPy.md)

2018:

  - [Go-HEP/xrootd: creating a pure-Go client for XRootD](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/blob/master/_gsocproposals/2018/proposal_GoHEPxrootd.md)

## Project proposal

  - send a PR against the HSF's github repository with your proposal (in Markdown)
  - need 2 co-mentors (for overlap during summer holidays)
  - prepare a couple of exercizes to assess level of candidates
  - receive, read CVs of all candidates

Finally: select a student.

  - July 9 - 13, 2018

Finally:

  - Mentors Submit Final Evaluations: August 14 - 21, 2018
  - Results Announced: August 22, 2018

## My timeline

Few hours per day to:

  - review PRs
  - interact with student (email, chat, skype, ...)

Based on the grand total of my 2 years of stats:

  - 3-4h per day at the beginning of the internship
  - less so in the middle (student becomes a bit more autonomous, less handholding required): 1-2h or just 1/2h
  - workload picks up a bit at the end (report to write and proof read, polishing stuff and all)

## RX

Candidates are required to write their own proposal, based off the one submitted by the organizations.

=> a bit strange at first, but indeed a good way for the students to grok the internship.

During the internship:

  - insist on small, iterative PRs
  - insist on writing **documented** code
  - insist on writing **tested** code
  - insist on having regular communication (I prefer emails + discussions PRs)

## RX - conclusions

  - borderline burn-out for the 2017 session
  - reduced # of proposals for 2018: better, more reusable, result
  - choose well your co-mentor, so you can take holidays during the summer

Overall, good experience, with usable code.
Lot's of work, but "free" for IN2P3.

Idea: 

  - What about a "Summer of Code @IN2P3" (or "Spring of code", or "Winter of code" ?)
