* Preamble

* Software in HEP

Historically, software in HEP has been written in *FORTRAN-77*.

- HEP people even wrote compilers
- HEP community even defined a few extensions (*MORTRAN*)

Mid-90's: migration to *C++*

Mid-2000's: *Python* gained tremendous mindshare 

- first thru the steering of *C++* binaries
- then as complete analyses gluing *C++* libraries together


* Software in HEP - some numbers

An LHC experiment (_e.g._ ATLAS, CMS) is ~3000 physicists but only a
fraction of those is developing code.

Reconstruction frameworks grew from ~3M SLOC to ~5M

Summing over all HEP software stack for e.g. ATLAS:

- event generators: ~1.4M SLOC (C++, FORTRAN-77)
- I/O libraries ~1.7M SLOC (C++)
- simulation libraries ~1.2M SLOC (C++)
- reconstruction framework ~5M SLOC (C++) + steering/configuration (~1M SLOC python) (want to have a look at the [[http://acode-browser.usatlas.bnl.gov/lxr/source/][ATLAS code]]? [[https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw][CMS code]]?)



*GCC:* ~7M SLOC

*Linux* *kernel* *3.6:* 15.9M SLOC

* People committing code to VCS per month

Wide variety of skill level
Large amount of churn
Once the physics data is pouring, people go and do physics instead of software

#* Software developers
#
#~300 active developers (per experiment)
#
#~1000 different developers integrated over the lifetime of a single LHC experiment.
#
#- few "real" s/w experts
#- some physicists with strong skill set in s/w
#- many with some experience in s/w development
#- some with *no* experience in s/w development
#
#A multi-timezone environment
#
#- Europe, North-America, Japan, Russia
#
#Many communities (core s/w people, generators, simulation, ...)
#
#Development and infrastructures usually CERN-centric
#
#Heavily Linux based ([[http://cern.ch/linux][Scientific Linux CERN]])

* Software development cycle

VCS (CVS, then SVN. GIT: almost there)

Nightlies (Jenkins or homegrown solution)

- need a sizeable cluster of build machines (distcc, ccache, ...)
- builds the framework stack in ~8h, produces ~2000 shared libraries
- installs them on AFS (also creates RPMs and tarballs)

Devs can then test and develop off the nightly _via_ AFS

Every 6 months or so a new production release is cut, validated (then patched) and deployed on the World Wide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).

Release size: *~5Gb*

- binaries, libraries (externals+framework stack)
- extra data (sqlite files, physics processes' modelisation data, ...)


* Software runtime ?

Big science, big data, big software, big numbers

- ~1min to initialize the application
- loading >500 shared libraries
- connecting to databases (detector description, geometry, ...)
- instantiating ~2000 C++ components
- 2Gb/4Gb memory footprint per process

* (obligatory xkcd reference)

.image _figs/xkcd-compiling.png 550 550

* Software in HEP

- big C++/python software stacks
- hard to compile (dependencies, build systems, ...)
- slow to compile
- hard to master (or even just understand)
- hard to read (because everybody is using their own subset of `C++`)
- hard to deploy
- not multicore/manycore-friendly

Google had similar issues...
Engineers @Google created `Go` while waiting for `C++` programs to compile.

* Let's Go

* The raison d'etre of Go

Goals:

- eliminate slowness (compilation, runtime)
- eliminate clumsiness
- improve effectiveness
- maintain (even improve) scale in a multicore/manycore world

Go was designed by and for people who write — and read and debug and maintain — large software systems.

Go's purpose is _not_ research into programming language design.

Go's purpose is to make its designers' (and users') programming lives better.

* What is Go ?

.play _code/hello.go

 $ go run hello.go
 Hello from Go

A nice language with a nice mascot.

* Elements of Go

- Founding fathers: Russ Cox, Robert Griesemer, Ian Lance Taylor, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson


- Concurrent, garbage-collected
- An Open-source general progamming language (BSD-3)
- feel of a *dynamic* *language*: limited verbosity thanks to the _type_ _inference_ _system_, map, slices
- safety of a *static* *type* *system*
- compiled down to machine language (so it is fast, goal is ~10% of C)
- *object-oriented* but w/o classes, *builtin* *reflection*
- first-class functions with *closures*
- implicitly satisfied *interfaces*

* Packages

* Packages

Every Go source file, e.g. `"encoding/json/json.go"`, starts like:

  package json

where `json` is the "package name", an identifier.
Package names are usually concise.

To use a package, need to identify it by path:

  import "encoding/json"

And then the package name is used to qualify items from package:

  var dec = json.NewDecoder(reader)

Clarity: can always tell if name is local to package from its syntax: `Name` vs. `pkg.Name`.
(More on this later.)
Package combines properties of library, name space, and module.

* Package paths are unique, not package names

The path is `"encoding/json"` but the package name is `json`.
The path identifies the package and must be unique. 
Project or company name at root of name space.

  import "go-hep/rand"

Package name might not be unique; can be overridden. These are both package `rand`:

  import "math/rand"           // Standard package
  import heprand "go-hep/rand" // HEP-specific package

Every HEP experiment might have its own `rand` package; no need to make the package name unique.

* Remote packages

Package path syntax works with remote repositories. 
The import path is just a string.

Can be a file, can be a URL:

  $> go get github.com/go-hep/hbook  ## Command to fetch, compile and install a package
                                     ## (and its dependencies)

  import "github.com/go-hep/hbook"   // go-hep HBOOK's import statement

  var hist hbook.H1D                 // Client's use of package

* Syntax

* Syntax

Syntax is not important...

- unless you're programming
- or writing tools

Tooling is essential, so Go has a clean syntax. 
Not super small, just clean:

- regular (mostly)
- only 25 keywords
- straightforward to parse (no type-specific context required)
- easy to predict, reason about

_The_readability_of_programs_is_immeasurably_more_important_than_their_writeability._
Hints on Programming Language Design 
C. A. R. Hoare 1973

* Declarations

Uses Pascal/Modula-style syntax: name before type, more type keywords.

  var fn func([]int) int
  type T struct { a, b int }

not

  int (*fn)(int[]);
  struct T { int a, b; }

Easier to parse—no symbol table needed. Tools become easier to write.
One nice effect: can drop var and derive type of variable from expression:

  var buf *bytes.Buffer = bytes.NewBuffer(x) // explicit
  buf := bytes.NewBuffer(x)                  // derived

For more information:

.link https://golang.org/s/decl-syntax

* Function syntax

Function on type T:

  func Abs(t T) float64

Method of type T:

  func (t T) Abs() float64

Variable (closure) of type T:

  negAbs := func(t T) float64 { return -Abs(t) }

In Go, functions can return multiple values. Common case: `error`.

  func ReadByte() (c byte, err error)
  
  c, err := ReadByte()
  if err != nil { ... }

* Naming

* Export syntax

Simple rule:

- upper case initial letter: `Name` is visible to clients of package
- otherwise: `name` (or `_Name`) is not visible to clients of package

Applies to variables, types, functions, methods, constants, fields....

That Is It.

One of the most important things about the language.

Can see the visibility of an identifier without discovering the declaration.

Clarity.

* Object-oriented programming

* OOP requires very little extra programming language support

We only need:

- the notion of an _Object_,
- a mechanism to interact with these objects (_Methods_),
- and support for polymorphism (_Interfaces_).

* Object-oriented programming in Go

Methods without classes
Interfaces without hierarchies
Code reuse without inheritance

Specifically:

- Any _value_ can be an _object_
- Any _type_ can play the role of a _class_
- _Methods_ can be attached to any _type_
- _Interfaces_ implement polymorphism.

* Methods

.play _code/methods.go

* Methods can be attached to any type

.play _code/methods-any-type.go

* Interfaces

.code _code/ifaces.go

An interface defines a set of methods. 
A type that implements all methods of an interface is said to implement the interface. 
All types implement the empty interface `interface{}`.

* Dynamic dispatch

.play _code/interface.go /START/,/STOP/

A value (here: `corner`, `boiling`) of a type (`Point`, `Celsius`) that implements 
an interface (`Stringer`) can be assigned to a variable (`v`) of that interface type.

* Composition and chaining

Typically, interfaces are small (1-3 methods).

Pervasive use of key interfaces in the standard library make it easy to chain APIs together.

  package io
  func Copy(dst Writer, src Reader) (int64, error)

The `io.Copy` function copies by reading from any `Reader` and writing to any `Writer`.

Interfaces are often introduced ad-hoc, and after the fact.

There is no explicit hierarchy and thus no need to design one!

* my-gunzip

.code _code/gunzip.go

* Interfaces in practice

Methods on any types and _ad_hoc_ interfaces make for a light-weight OO programming style.

Go interfaces enable post-facto abstraction.

No explicit type hierarchies.

"Plug'n play" in a type-safe way.

* Concurrency

* Interlude: concurrency & parallelism

- *Concurrency* is about _dealing_ with lots of things at once.
- *Parallelism* is about _doing_ lots of things at once.
- Not the same, but related.
- Concurrency is about _structure_, parallelism is about _execution_.

.image _figs/conc-para.png 200 600

Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently.
Communication is the means to coordinate the independent executions.

* Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

Concurrency is about (program) *structure*.
Parallelism is about (program) *execution*.

.image _figs/conc-vs-par-prog.png 300 _

Concurrency is *not* parallelism, it's better :)

* Concurrency plus communication

Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently.

Communication is the means to coordinate the independent executions.

This is the Go model and (like Erlang and others) it's based on CSP:

C. A. R. Hoare: Communicating Sequential Processes (CACM 1978)

* A model for software construction

Easy to understand.

Easy to use.

Easy to reason about.

You don't need to be an expert!

(Much nicer than dealing with the minutiae of parallelism (threads, semaphores, locks, barriers, etc.))

* Basic examples

* A boring function

We need an example to show the interesting properties of the concurrency primitives.
To avoid distraction, we make it a boring example.

.play _code/boring.go /START/,/STOP/

* Slightly less boring

Make the intervals between messages unpredictable (still under a second).

.play _code/lessboring.go /START/,/STOP/

* Running it

The boring function runs on forever, like a boring party guest.

.play _code/lessboring.go /^func.main/,$

* Ignoring it

The `go` statement runs the function as usual, but doesn't make the caller wait.

It launches a goroutine.

The functionality is analogous to the `&` on the end of a shell command.

.play _code/goboring.go 1,/^}/


* Ignoring it a little less

When `main` returns, the program exits and takes the boring function down with it.

We can hang around a little, and on the way show that both main and the launched goroutine are running.

.play _code/waitgoboring.go /func.main/,/^}/

* Goroutines

What is a goroutine? It's an independently executing function, launched by a go statement.

It has its own call stack, which grows and shrinks as required.

It's very cheap. It's practical to have thousands, even hundreds of thousands of goroutines.

It's not a thread.

There might be only one thread in a program with thousands of goroutines.

Instead, goroutines are multiplexed dynamically onto threads as needed to keep all the goroutines running.

But if you think of it as a very cheap thread, you won't be far off.

* Communication

Our boring examples cheated: the main function couldn't see the output from the other goroutine.

It was just printed to the screen, where we pretended we saw a conversation.

Real conversations require communication.

* Channels

A channel in Go provides a connection between two goroutines, allowing them to communicate.

.code _code/helpers.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.code _code/helpers.go /START2/,/STOP2/
.code _code/helpers.go /START3/,/STOP3/

* Using channels

A channel connects the main and boring goroutines so they can communicate.

.play _code/changoboring.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.code _code/changoboring.go /START2/,/STOP2/

* Synchronization

When the main function executes <–c, it will wait for a value to be sent.

Similarly, when the boring function executes c <– value, it waits for a receiver to be ready.

A sender and receiver must both be ready to play their part in the communication. Otherwise we wait until they are.

Thus channels both communicate and synchronize.

* The Go approach

Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.

* "Patterns"

* Generator: function that returns a channel

Channels are first-class values, just like strings or integers.

.play _code/generatorboring.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.code _code/generatorboring.go /START2/,/STOP2/

* Channels as a handle on a service

Our boring function returns a channel that lets us communicate with the boring service it provides.

We can have more instances of the service.

.play _code/generator2boring.go /START1/,/STOP1/

* Multiplexing

These programs make Joe and Ann count in lockstep.
We can instead use a fan-in function to let whosoever is ready talk.

.code _code/faninboring.go /START3/,/STOP3/
.play _code/faninboring.go /START1/,/STOP1/

* Fan-in

.image _figs/gophermegaphones.jpg

* Restoring sequencing

Send a channel on a channel, making goroutine wait its turn.

Receive all messages, then enable them again by sending on a private channel.

First we define a message type that contains a channel for the reply.

.code _code/sequenceboring.go /START0/,/STOP0/

* Restoring sequencing.

Each speaker must wait for a go-ahead.

.code _code/sequenceboring.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.code _code/sequenceboring.go /START2/,/STOP2/
.play _code/sequenceboring.go /START3/,/STOP3/

* Select

A control structure unique to concurrency.

The reason channels and goroutines are built into the language.

* Select

The select statement provides another way to handle multiple channels.
It's like a switch, but each case is a communication:

- All channels are evaluated.
- Selection blocks until one communication can proceed, which then does.
- If multiple can proceed, select chooses pseudo-randomly.
- A default clause, if present, executes immediately if no channel is ready.

.code _code/select.go /START0/,/STOP0/

* Fan-in again

Rewrite our original fanIn function. Only one goroutine is needed. Old:

.code _code/faninboring.go /START3/,/STOP3/

* Fan-in using select

Rewrite our original fanIn function. Only one goroutine is needed. New:

.play _code/selectboring.go /START3/,/STOP3/

* Timeout using select

The time.After function returns a channel that blocks for the specified duration.
After the interval, the channel delivers the current time, once.

.play _code/timeout.go /START1/,/STOP1/

* Timeout for whole conversation using select

Create the timer once, outside the loop, to time out the entire conversation.
(In the previous program, we had a timeout for each message.)

.play _code/timeoutall.go /START1/,/STOP1/


* Quit channel

We can turn this around and tell Joe to stop when we're tired of listening to him.

.code _code/quit.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.play _code/quit.go /START2/,/STOP2/


* Receive on quit channel

How do we know it's finished? Wait for it to tell us it's done: receive on the quit channel

.code _code/rcvquit.go /START1/,/STOP1/
.play _code/rcvquit.go /START2/,/STOP2/

* Daisy-chain

.play _code/daisy.go /func/,$

* Chinese whispers, gopher style

.image _figs/gophereartrumpet.jpg

* Conclusions

Goroutines and channels make it easy to express complex operations dealing with:

- multiple inputs
- multiple outputs
- timeouts
- failure

And they're fun to use.

* Go in science

* Science-y packages

* Application to HEP-offline

* fads

`fads` is a "FAst Detector Simulation" toolkit.

- morally a translation of [[https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes][C++-Delphes]] into Go
- uses [[https://github.com/go-hep/fwk][go-hep/fwk]] to expose, manage and harness concurrency into the usual `HEP` event loop (`initialize` | `process-events` | `finalize`)
- uses [[https://github.com/go-hep/hbook][go-hep/hbook]] for histogramming, [[htpps://github.com/go-hep/hepmc][go-hep/hepmc]] for `HepMC` input/output

Code is on github (BSD-3):

* go-hep/fads - Installation

As easy as:

  $> export GOPATH=$HOME/dev/gocode
  $> export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
  
  $> go get github.com/go-hep/fads/...

Yes, with the ellipsis at the end, to also install sub-packages.

- `go` `get` will recursively download and install all the packages that [[https://github.com/go-hep/fads][go-hep/fads]] depends on. (no `Makefile` needed)

Cross-compilation to `linux/arm64`:

  $> GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go get github.com/go-hep/fads/...

Cross-compilation to `windows/amd64`:

  $> GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go get github.com/go-hep/fads/...

* go-hep/fwk - Concurrency

[[https://github.com/go-hep/fwk][fwk]] enables:
- event-level concurrency
- tasks-level concurrency

[[https://github.com/go-hep/fwk][fwk]] relies on [[https://golang.org][Go]]'s runtime to properly schedule _goroutines_.

For sub-task concurrency, users are by construction required to use [[https://golang.org][Go]]'s constructs (_goroutines_ and _channels_) so everything is consistent *and* the _runtime_ has the *complete* *picture*.


* go-hep/fads - real world use case

- translated [[https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/delphes][C++-Delphes]]' ATLAS data-card into Go
- [[https://github.com/go-hep/fads/blob/master/cmd/fads-app/main.go][go-hep/fads-app]]
- installation:

  $ go get github.com/go-hep/fads/cmd/fads-app
  $ fads-app -help
  Usage: fads-app [options] <hepmc-input-file>
  
  ex:
   $ fads-app -l=INFO -evtmax=-1 ./testdata/hepmc.data
  
  options:
    -cpu-prof=false: enable CPU profiling
    -evtmax=-1: number of events to process
    -l="INFO": log level (DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR)
    -nprocs=0: number of concurrent events to process

* go-hep/fads - components

- a `HepMC` converter
- particle propagator
- calorimeter simulator
- energy rescaler, momentum smearer
- isolation
- b-tagging, tau-tagging
- jet-finder (reimplementation of FastJet in Go: [[https://github.com/go-hep/fastjet][go-hep/fastjet]])
- histogram service (from [[https://github.com/go-hep/fwk][go-hep/fwk]])

Caveats:

- no real persistency to speak of (_i.e.:_ `JSON`, `ASCII` and `Gob`)
- jet clustering limited to N^3 (slowest and dumbest scheme of `C++-FastJet`)

* Conclusion

Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.

Go is great at writing small and large (concurrent) programs.
Also true for science-y programs, even if the amount of HEP-oriented libraries can still be improved.
