## Disclaimer

I used to be a `FORTRAN` programmer, then, a `C++` programmer, and after that, a `python` programmer.

Nowadays, I am a [Go](https://golang.org) programmer at heart, enjoying blazing fast compilation time, builtin concurrency constructs, easy installation and deployment, etc...

I really learned parallel/concurrent programming with `Go`.
My views on parallel programming with `C++` are thus somewhat skewed.

## Parallel programming

Parallel programming is hard.
Parallel programming is harder in `C++`.

Actually, why do we have to do **parallel** programming ?

## Raining transistors

  - Frequency has plateaued
  - **But** number of transistors is still following (more or less) Moore's Law

What can we do with them ?

## Parallel programming

Ok, so we have to do parallel programming to properly utilize our new
hardware...

Actually, are we really sure we want to do **parallel** programming ?

## Concurrency vs Parallelism

_Concurrency:_ programming as the composition of independently executing processes/tasks.

_Parallelism:_ programming as the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations.

## Interlude: Sequential, Concurrent & Parallel pizzas

## Pizza recipe

(**Disclaimer:** don't ever eat any pizza prepared or cooked by me.)

How to prepare a (sequential) pizza?

.code code/make-pizza.f

Estimated time (1 chef, 1 pizza):

	xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###

How to make this faster?

## (Sequential) Pizza recipe

Tasks:

  - wash tomatoes and onions
  - cut tomatoes, onions
  - prepare pizza dough
  - put tomato sauce on top of pizza dough
  - toppings: put tomatoes, onions, ham and mozarella
  - (pre-)heat oven, bake
  - (cut, then eat)

Estimated time (1 chef, 1 pizza):

	xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###

## Concurrent pizzas - Parallel pizzas

Estimated time (1 chef, 1 kitchen, 2 pizzas):

	xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###-xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###

Estimated time (1 chef, 2 kitchens, 2 pizzas):

	xx-oooo-xxx-oo+###
	              +xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###

Estimated time (2 chefs, 1 kitchen, 2 pizzas):

	xx-xxx-+-xx-xxx-+
	       +###     +###
	oooo-oo+-oooo-oo+

Estimated time (2 chefs, 2 kitchens, 2 pizzas):

	xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###
	xx-oooo-xxx-oo-###

## Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

Concurrency is about (program) **structure**.
Parallelism is about (program) **execution**.

## Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency and parallelism are related.
Concurrency isn't parallelism (it's better!)

Parallelizing an application is done by:

  - finding concurrency in the problem
  - exposing the concurrency in the source code
  - exploiting the exposed concurrency to complete the job in less time.

.image figs/conc-vs-par-decomp.png

## Decomposition in parallel programs

Every parallel program is based on concurrency
i.e: tasks defined by an application that can run at the same time.

**EVERY** parallel program requires a _task decomposition_ and a _data decomposition_:

  - Task decomposition: break the application down into a set of tasks that can execute concurrently.
  - Data decomposition: How must the data be broken down into chunks and associated with threads/processes to make the parallel program run efficiently.

## Goldilocks

Parallel approaches have to find the "sweet spot" between two extremes.

Too fine grained:

  - Data: computation dominated by overhead
  - Tasks: context switching overhead

Too coarse grained:

  - Data: load balancing problems
  - Tasks: insufficient items to keep processes busy

## Parallel programming: multi-process vs multi-threaded

Multi-process:

  - resource requirements are multiplied w/ nbr of process instances
  - (clever) use of `fork(2)` can mitigate this issue (but not in a `MT` environment)
  - one process can not corrupt the memory of another process
  - overhead of pushing data from one process to the other

Multi-threaded:

  - small context switch times (wrt an OS' process)
  - automatic sharing of many hardware resources (memory, fds, sockets...)
  - thread-safety of external libraries?
  - one thread can corrupt another thread

`FairRoot` design can cater for both (`MP` _via_ `ZeroMQ` or `NanoMQ` message queues)

## Multi-threading & Multi-processing in a C++ world

Modern architectures impose massive challenges on programmability in the context of performance portability.

  - massive increase in on-node parallelism
  - deep memory hierarchies

Only **portable** parallelization solution for `C++` programmers (today?): **OpenMP** & **MPI**

  - hugely successful for years
  - widely used and supported
  - simple use for simple cases
  - very portable
  - highly optimized

_Which_ `C++` BTW ?

## C++ timeline

`C++` is a wide and complex language.
Know your `C++` and the (subset of?) `C++` you are **allowed** to write!

  - `C++03`?
  - `C++11`?
  - `C++14`?

.image figs/wg21-timeline.png 300 _

## Parallelism in C++

`C++11` introduced lower level abstractions:

  - `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::future`, ...
  - fairly limited, more is needed
  - `C++` needs stronger support for higher-level parallelism

Several proposals to the Standardization Committee are accepted or under consideration:

  - Technical Specification: Concurrency
  - Technical Specification: Parallelism
  - Other smaller proposals: resumable functions, task regions, executors

## Parallelism in C++

Currently, there is no overarching vision related to higher-level parallelism

  - goal is to standardize on a "big story" by 2020
  - no need for OpenMP, OpenACC, OpenCL, etc...

But for the moment, `C++` programmers are stuck with `C++11/14`...

## Interlude: memory model & tools

## Memory model

With `C++11`, finally `C++` has a memory model that contemplates a multi-threaded execution of a program.

A thread is a single flow of control within a program

  - Every thread can potentially access every object and function in the program
  - The interleaving of each thread's instructions is undefined

.image figs/thread-exec-race.png

## Memory model

`C++` guarantees that two threads can update and access **separate** memory locations without interfering with each other.

  - For all other situations updates and accesses have to be properly synchronized (_ie:_ atomics, locks, memory fences)
  - If updates and accesses to the same location by multiple threads are not properly synchronized, there is a data race (_ie:_ undefined behavior)
  - Data races can be made visible by transformations applied by the compiler or by the processor for performance reasons

## Tools to support parallel programming development/debugging

.link http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html
.link http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html
.link http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html

Detect races at runtime:

  - needs a test case and workload that triggers a race
  - no false positive, but can not detect all possible races

Needs a recompilation (`TSan`), (dramatic) increase of resources requirements at
runtime (CPU, VMem) b/c of code instrumentation and bookkeeping.

## C++ parallel programming: building blocks

## C++11 std::thread

`C++11` (finally!) standardized threads

  - `std::thread` is now part of the standard `C++` library
  - `std::thread` is an abstraction and maps to local platform threads (`POSIX`, `Windows(TM)`, ...)

## C++11 std::thread

.code code/hello-par.cxx

	$> g++ -o hello-par --std=c++11 -pthread hello-par.cxx
	$> ./hello-par
	** inside thread 139800850654976!

## C++11 std::thread - avoiding errors

.code code/hello-2.cxx

**(1)** Thread function must do **exception handling**: unhandled exception => program termination

**(2)** Must join with _thread_ **before** handle goes out of scope, otherwise:
program termination.

## Programming style

  - Old school: thread functions (what we just saw)
  - Middle school: function objects (functors)

.code code/par-functors.cxx

## Programming style

  - New school: `C++11` lambda functions (aka anonymous functions)

It's all about trade-offs...

**Lambda functions:**

  - easier and more readable (once your brained has been trained)
  - code remains inline
  - potentially more **dangerous** (`[&]` captures everything by reference)

**Functions:**

  - more efficient: lambdas involve class, function objects
  - potentially **safer**: requires explicit variable scoping
  - more cumbersome

## Example: matrix multiply

.image figs/matrix-multiply.png

## Sequential version

.image figs/matrix-multiply-seq.png

## Structured (fork-join) parallelism

A common pattern when creating multiple threads

## Parallel solution

## Types of parallelism

Most common types:

  - Data
  - Task
  - Embarrassingly parallel
  - Dataflow

## Data parallelism

.image figs/par-types-data.png

## Task parallelism

.image figs/par-types-task.png

## Embarrassingly parallel

.image figs/par-types-emb-par.png

## Dataflow

.image figs/par-types-dataflow.png

## C++ concurrency features

.image figs/cxx-features.png

## Futures

**Futures** provide a higher level of abstraction

  - you start an asynchronous/parallel operation
  - you are returned a handle to wait for the result
  - thread creation, join and exceptions are handled for you

## std::async + std::future

.image figs/future-async.png

## async operations

.image figs/future-async-2.png

## (no) Conclusions

That's all for today.
Many more to cover, though:

  - SIMD
  - Thread Building Blocks (`Intel` `TBB`)
  - `FPGA`
  - (auto-)vectorization
  - `OpenCL / OpenMP / OpenACC`
  - HPX
  - ...

## To recap

Remember the pizzas?

  - know your **resources** (# of chefs, \# of kitchens, ovens)
  - know the **tasks** (cut, pre-heat, bake) and their **dependencies**, composing the overall goal (pizza)
  - know the **latencies** (pre-heating) and the **bottlenecks** (oven) of your main task
  - infer/learn the **optimal** resources for the task(s) at hand (some cooks/kitchens are better at making pizzas, other: calzones)

(imperfect) analogy:

  - chef: thread of execution
  - kitchen: CPU Core, GPU, FPGA, ...
  - oven: disk, memory, i/o, ...
